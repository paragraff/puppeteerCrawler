# Just for fun package

Scrapers and antiscrapers war is never ended. More about it [here].
Why not to make fun on it?

Create env.json with parameters:
 - pathToBrowser - path to executable file. If you want to crawl from some specific browser
 - urlToCrowl - page url for crowling
 - pathToBrowserUserData - if you want to store browser user data
 - validationRequestUrl - if page has anti scraping defense and you want to know its protocol
